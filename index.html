    <h1 class="a">Happy new year 2025</h1> <br>
    <hr class="hi"> <br>
   
    
    <h3 class="b">What makes a year best  ? happiness? No ❌</h3>
        <h3 class="tic">It’s the problems we face and how we overcome them✅
        </h3>  <br>

    <h3 class="c">
        2024 may be the worst year you may ever see in your entire life but without
        Dreams and problems, we are nothing
        
        
        </h3> <br> <br>

    <h2 class="d">
        Life is like a sky and the clouds are the problems 
        </h2>

    <h3 class="e">Look at the blank blue sky for a while—it becomes boring. But a sky with moving clouds and the sun playing hide-and-seek behind the clouds? That’s way more interesting than the boring one.  </h3>
    <br><h2 class="f">You want peace? peace demands problems.
        Even, Heaven demands death.
        </h2> <br>

    <h4 class="i">It's normal to have problems ,but it’s not okay to stay still.  because if you stopped at problem now you can’t see big problems ,when you  face the big problem, the current problems are not even visible to you </h4>
    <br><h3 class="k">Think about it:</h3> 
    <h3 class="j"> When we were in  the 10th standard, getting good marks felt like the biggest problems.Fast forward to 12th standard, and those 10th-standard problems didn’t even feel like problems anymore. Look at now: studying isn’t even a problem.

         That’s how life works—bigger challenges make older ones seem smaller.

 
    </h3> <br> <br>
    

    <h3 class="l">So, face your problems and overcome them. Then, face bigger problems and overcome those too.
        
        </h3>
        <br>
 
       <h2 class="w"> I know—it’s easy to say it in words.</h2> <br>

    <h3 class="x">As the young legend once said:</h3>
        <h2 class="m,">"It’s all on you because you are the main character here.
        Imagine a main character without any problems or struggles—would that be interesting?"
        </h2> <br><br>

    <h3 class="n"> If you don’t have problems, even that becomes a problem.
        I’m not trying to motivate you—I’m just here to remind you, as a bro
        </h3><br> <center>
            <img src="img/FLLhfuNXsAQFjC1.jpg" width="700px"></center>

    <h3 class="o">Let 2025 be the life-changer!. Don’t be part of the “new year, new me” crowd—it doesn’t last more than 1 or 2 weeks, or maybe a month. But you have to be constant, unchangeable. Set a mental image of the better version of yourself and live like that. Because we are breathing, we are alive—don’t miss this.</h3>
    <br><br><h3 class="">If you’ve read this to the very end in the attention-grabbing zombie world, it’s my honor to respect you. Can you send me a thumbs-up "👍" in my DM .so, I  can know my 7 days of work weren’t wasted?</h3>
